description: Hubert Price, a struggling young playwright with one moderate success
  under his belt, is bequeathed a legacy by his uncle. His focus on repeating his
  theatrical success, and his love for the beautiful Julia, blinds him to the tragic,
  obsessive love of his disinherited cousin, Emily.
